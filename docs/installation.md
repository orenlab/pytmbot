## ðŸ”Œ Installation

There are three ways for today:

1. Use a pre-build bot image from GitHub registry (default
   way): [instructions in this section](github-registry-install.md)

2. Use a pre-build bot image from hub.docker.com. Then, please follow
   the [instructions](https://hub.docker.com/r/orenlab/pytmbot) posted on the Docker Hub.

3. Assemble the image of the bot yourself: [instructions in this section](self-build.md)
