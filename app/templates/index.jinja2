Hi *{{ first_name }}*,
I'm a bot for server monitoring here to help you keep an eye on your server.
I'm still learning, but today I can provide you with some useful information.

Here's what I can tell you:

🐳 *A large section on Docker*

- Information about containers (even those that have finished work)
- The ability to view container logs
- Information about images

💡 *Features*

- Load average information
- Summary memory usage information (with swap)
- Sensors information
- Summary process information
- Uptime information
- File system base information
- Basic information about the network connection


My knowledge is still growing, so I recommend checking back periodically to see what I've learned.
If there is anything else that I can help you with, please let me know. You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/orenlab/pytmbot/)
