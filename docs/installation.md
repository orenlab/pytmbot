# pyTMBot Installation and Setup Guide

## ðŸ”Œ Installation

You have three options for installing pyTMBot:

1. **Use a Pre-built Docker Image (Recommended)**

   The easiest way to get started is by using a pre-built Docker image. Follow
   the [instructions on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/orenlab/pytmbot) to pull and run the image.

2. **Use a Pre-built Docker Image from GitHub Registry**

   If you prefer using the GitHub registry, follow
   the [installation instructions in this section](github_registry_install.md). This method may be preferred for those
   who use GitHub as their primary source for Docker images.

3. **Build the Docker Image Yourself**

   For advanced users who want to build the Docker image from source, follow
   the [self-build instructions](self_build.md). This option allows you to customize the build process but requires
   additional setup.

Choose the method that best suits your needs and follow the detailed instructions provided in the respective sections.
Each method has its advantages depending on your preferences and requirements.
