# pyTMBot installation and setup guide

## ðŸ”Œ Installation

There are two ways for today:

1. ~~Use a pre-build bot image. Then, please follow
   the [instructions](https://hub.docker.com/r/orenlab/pytmbot) posted on the Docker Hub.~~

_Unfortunately, I, like many other software developers in my country, no longer have the ability to provide updates to
hub.docker.com. This is a decision made by Docker Inc., and it is not something that I can influence in any way._

1. Installation using the GitHub registry (default way): [instructions in this section](github-registry-install.md)

2. Assemble the image of the bot yourself: [instructions in this section](self-build.md)
