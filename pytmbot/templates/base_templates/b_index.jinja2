Hello, *{{ first_name }}*! 👋

I’m *pyTMbot*, a versatile Telegram bot designed for Docker management, server monitoring, and extending functionality through plugins. I support both polling and webhook modes and can be deployed on your host machine or inside a Docker container.

Here’s what I can do:

🐳 *Docker Management*
- Start, stop, restart, and manage containers
- Monitor real-time status of running/stopped containers
- Access and search detailed container logs
- Inspect and manage Docker images (tags, metadata)
- *NEW*: Check for Docker image updates (compare local tags with Docker Hub)

🖥️ *Server Monitoring*
- Load average and system uptime
- Memory and swap usage
- Real-time sensor data
- Process summary and control
- Network and file system information
- *NEW*: Quick system and Docker summary

🔌 *Plugin System*
- Extend my functionality with custom plugins:
  - *Monitor Plugin*: Track CPU, memory, disk usage, and Docker changes.
  - *2FA Plugin*: Two-factor authentication via QR codes and TOTP.
  - *Outline VPN Plugin*: Monitor your Outline VPN server.

🔖 *Additional Features*
- Check for bot updates: `/check_bot_updates`
- Emoji support for better interaction 😎
- Templated responses powered by Jinja2
- Extensive logging via Docker log aggregators

I’m constantly improving, so check back often for updates! If you have questions or suggestions, let me know. You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/orenlab/pytmbot/).

Happy monitoring! 🚀
