# pyTMbot

A simple Telegram bot to handle **Docker** `containers` and `images`, also providing basic information about the status
of
**local** servers.
The bot operates synchronously. It does not use webhooks.

The bot was written using the [pyTelegramBotAPI](https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI).
Use [psutil](https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil) and [docker-py](https://github.com/docker/docker-py) libraries for
gather information.

## üí° Key Features

### üê≥ A large section on Docker

__Some of the features are protected by two-factor authentication, which is built into pyTMbot v.2__

- Container management (start, stop, restart, etc.)
- Key information about the current status of containers (even those that have finished work)
- Ability to access container logs
- Key information about images

### üñ•Ô∏è A large section on local servers

- Load average information
- Summary memory usage information (with swap)
- Sensors information
- Summary process information
- Uptime information
- File system base information
- Basic information about the network connection

### üîñ Additionally:

- The "About Me" section, which allows users to check for updates regarding the bot: `/check_bot_updates`
- The `Jinja2` templating engine is used to generate the responses.
- The bot logs are accessible in the Docker log aggregator.
- And of course we use emoji üòÖ

Screenshots are available here: [screenshots.md](docs/screenshots.md).

## üï∏ Requirements

Initially, I designed the bot to run only inside a Docker container. However, this method has some limitations, so from
version 0.9.0 onward, it is possible to install the bot locally outside the container. At the same time, the bot will
still be able to function and receive information about Docker containers.

Full list of Python dependencies see in `requirements.txt`. List of Python dependencies for self setup bot see
in `setup_req.txt`

## üîå Installation, setup and run bot

- _See [installation.md](docs/installation.md)_

## üõ° Secure

There has been a significant architectural change in pyTMbot v.2, and in addition to this, several new security measures
have been implemented in the bot.

One of the main changes is the addition of a "superuser" role, which gives Docker container management rights. This
allows users to manage containers more securely and efficiently.

Another important new feature is native TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password) two-factor authentication. This method uses
a unique code generated by a time-based algorithm to verify a user's identity, making it much more difficult for
unauthorized users to access critical functions of the bot. The lifetime of the session is also limited and controlled,
ensuring that sessions do not last indefinitely.

Despite the introduction of these new measures, the basic protection mechanisms of the bot have not been abandoned. They
have been optimized to continue protecting the bot from unauthorized access.

You can learn more about these changes and the benefits they provide in our blog [post](#).

## üí¢ Supported commands

In addition to button navigation, the bot also supports commands. Below is a list of commands and their details:

| # | Command              | Keyboard button      | Note                                   | 
|---|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1 | `/start`             | None                 | -                                      | 
| 2 | `/help`              | None                 | -                                      | 
| 3 | `/docker`            | üê≥ Docker            | -                                      |
| 4 | `/containers`        | üß∞ Containers        | Button available in the Docker section |
| 5 | `/images`            | üñºÔ∏è Images           | Button available in the Docker section |
| 6 | `/back`              | üîô Back to main menu | Button available in the Docker section |
| 7 | `/check_bot_updates` | None                 | -                                      |
