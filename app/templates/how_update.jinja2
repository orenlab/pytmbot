🏗 Updating the image

In order to update the image to the latest version, please follow these steps:

- Stopping the running pyTMbot container:

```bash
sudo docker stop pytmbot
```

- Deleting an outdated container:

```bash
sudo docker rm pytmbot
```

- Deleting an outdated image:

```bash
sudo docker rmi pytmbot
```

- Uploading an updated image:

```bash
sudo docker pull orenlab/pytmbot:latest
```

And we run it in the same way as we would if we had just installed the bot (see the instructions above).
